/**
 * <p>
 * <code>S8Shell</code> represents an enclosure of a graph of S8Object. This
 * shell has multiple role:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>#1 LOGICAL UNIT: It defines a logical unit from the application logic
 * point of view</li>
 * <li>#2 SYNCHRONIZATION: It is the primary scope of lock enabling async
 * processes</li>
 * <li>#3 STORAGE UNIT: It acts a persistency bucket (and therefore must be
 * considered the main element to understand the latency of the application
 * implementation.)</li>
 * <li>#4 VERSION UNIT: It is the key building block for substitution pattern,
 * that acts as a repository state.</li>
 * <li>#5 ENCAPSULATION: It is the primary encapsulation control unit. Note that
 * we cannot access (from a logical point of view the inner nodes of the graph
 * encapsulated by the shell, unless they are specifically designated as logical
 * ports of the shell.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that <code>S8object</code> objects used as logical ports SHOULD refer
 * the shell (typically as a field).
 * </p>
 * 
 *

/**
 * <p>Unpinned object applications:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>transient</b>: object created on the fly that don't need any S8Shell handling and management</li>
 * <li><b>private</b>: none of <code>S8Struct</code> object method are exposed for direct request</li>
 * <li><b>managed</b>: acess control is non-existent (for access control, upgrade to <code>S8Object</code></li>
 * <li><b>leaves</b>: typical used as leaves of a tree which nodes are <code>S8Object</code></li>
 * </ul>
