	/**
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Important explanation on why it's coded that way</b>.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Assume you have a -slightly- complex ByteOutflowable object: it's called
	 * <code>ThFluid</code> and it contains all properties of a given fluid. Let's
	 * ay that they are limite nb of fluids (air, water, methane, etc.) so that you
	 * can simply assign a number to them (CAS number in real life). The trick is
	 * that there is multiple types of fluids (like for instance
	 * <code>ImcompressibleFluid</code> or <code>PerfetGasThFluid</code>, eah
	 * bringing it's own formula, equation of state and so on. So when reading the
	 * encoding of the fluid, there is a rot switch that will call sub-factories (on
	 * specialized on perfect gas, another one in incompressible fluid, etc.).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * That being said, say you are now building a parsing/composing engine for
	 * serilization/persistency or whatever. You stumble on a field which has a type
	 * that actually implementts the <code>ByteOutflowable</code> interface, but it
	 * MUST have a method to indicate the PROPER factory to be used for
	 * deserializing this type of field. In the case described in previous
	 * paragraph, the factory cannot be a constant of for instance
	 * <code>ImcompressibleFluid</code> since type parsing may need to be done at an
	 * higher level (for instance <code>ThFluid</code>) to enable the possibility to
	 * switch dynamically between differnt types of fluid with a unified encoding
	 * (for instance first type gives the type of fluid and allows to switch to a
	 * give factory, then each factory will continue to read bytes, each one havong
	 * it's own byte pattern). If relying on constant fields, override is extremly
	 * painful since we cannot select from a specific class the right factory. For
	 * instance tf the type of the fiekd is simply Impcoressible, we might want to
	 * restrain encoding to simply the one give by this specific factory.
	 * </p>
